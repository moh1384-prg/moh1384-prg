<h3 align="left">👩‍💻  About Me</h3>

###

<p>I am a Junior Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation recently acquired through an intensive 12 weeks coding bootcamp at <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course">Le Wagon</a>.

In my previous roles, I have successfully transitioned from diverse professions, including working as an Oil & Gas Directional Driller & Minicab Driver, to then the world of full stack web development. During this I have had the opportunity to work on a couple projects, such as a full stack web application (G.P.Ice) and an Airbnb like clone called Vista Villa. These experiences have equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of user needs and the ability to create meaningful digital experiences.
My background in different professional fields has developed my problem-solving skills and user-focused approach, which I am eager to apply further in future projects. I am passionate about building user-friendly, scalable web applications and continuously improving my technical skills.</p>
